# Compiler

MiniC is a compiler that translates a small subset of the C programming language to x86 assembly. This is a work in progress. I've written the lexer and parser by hand, using a top-down recursive descent parser to generate the syntax tree. I'll update this readme as I add more functionality to the compiler. The `Tests` folder will always contain programs that the compiler succesfully translates, with the most recent commits containing more advanced functionality.
